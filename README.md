# XPDES
eXtreme Partial Differential Equations Solver:
The goal of this project is to provide an open source partial differential equation solver for black holes in modified gravity. The open source nature is intended to allow anyone to modify the numerical infrastructure to any modified theory of gravity they desire.

To get started, see the documentation provided in MasterDoc.pdf in the Documentation folder. This describes the structure of the XPDES project folder and details the full execution of the numerical infrastructure.
